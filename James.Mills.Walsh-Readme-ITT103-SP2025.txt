PY WIZARDS POS SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

 Purpose of the Program
This program is a Point of Sale (POS) system that allows users to interact with a predefined product catalog, 
add items to a shopping cart, and process transactions.

 How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python or a similar coding program installed on your system (Python 3 is recommended).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
4. Run the program using the command:
   
   python James.Mills.Walsh-POS_Program-ITT103-SP2025.py
   
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the POS system.

Features
- Displays a product catalog with prices and stock availability.
- Allows users to add items to a shopping cart.
- Checks stock availability before adding items.
- Calculate the total cost of the cart.
- Processes transactions and updates stock levels accordingly.

 Required Modifications
- The product catalog is predefined; to add new products, modify the 'products' dictionary in the script.
- The checkout process currently assumes full payment; additional payment options can be implemented.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) can be added to provide a better user experience.

 Assumptions and Limitations
- The program assumes that the user inputs valid product names when adding items to the cart.
- It does not support multiple payment methods or partial payments.
- Stock levels are updated only upon successful transactions; refunds or returns are not handled.
- There is no database integration; all data is stored in memory and lost when the program exits.
